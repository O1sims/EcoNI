# EcoNI
An [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [Java Spring](https://spring.io/) project, inspired by Chris Trotter's work, in which we attempt to make Northern Ireland's public data more accessible to researchers, developers and academics by providing a repository and API for Northern Irish economic data.
